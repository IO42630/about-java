== Principles

Synchronization consists of _mutual exclusion_ (mutex) and _cooperation_.

[cols="10,30"]
|===
| Monitor |
    Every Java object has a single monitor. A monitor can be owned by one thread. +
    Every `class` also has a single monitor. It is used for synchronizing static _monitor regions_.
| Owner | Thread that owns the monitor.
| Tournament |when a monitor is released - generally the threads in entry set will compete for it.
| Monitor Region | Is a section of code.
A monitor may be associated with multiple regions.
While a thread executes a monitor region,
no other thread may execute another monitor region of same monitor. +
Examples: +
> synchronized method +
> synchronized block

|[1]|entering the monitor |
    Thread arrives at the beginning of a _monitor region_.
2+|Entry Set |
    Thread will participate in next tournament.
|[2]| acquiring the monitor |
    Thread won the _tournament_. +
    Thread becomes _owner_. +
    Thread starts executing _monitor region_.
|Owner|owning the monitor|
    Owner may: +
    > `Object.notify()` to notify a random thread in _wait set_. +
    > `Object.notifyAll()` to notify all threads in _wait set_.
|[3]| releasing the monitor|
    Owner calls `Object.wait()` & moves to _wait set_. +
    Tournament starts. +
    `Object.wait(1000)` may specify a timer. +
    When timer expires, the waiting thread will "notify itself".
2+|Wait Set |
    Waiting threads only participate in tournament if notified.
| [4] |acquiring the monitor |
    Owner executed `Object.notify()`. +
    Owner exited the monitor. +
    Thread in _wait set_ may compete for ownership.
|[5]| exiting the monitor| Owner finishes executing a monitor region. +
Tournament is started.

|Sentence|Meaning
|wait and notify| `wait()` and `notify()` are used.
|signal and continue| Owner first signals via `notify()`. +
Owner then continues executing the monitor region.

==== Conclusions:
** `static` and non-`static` _monitor regions_ don't block each other.
** For blocks it matters what object is used as lock.
** Two instances have two locks, thus don't block each other.
** Use static setters for static fields.

==== Examples

|`concurrent_modification.Problem.java`| Concurrent modification leads to corrupted data.
|`concurrent_modification.Solution.java`| by using `synchronized` setter.
|`concurrent_modification.SolutionFail.java`| Synchronization fails if synchronization happens on two different objects.

'''

== Thread & Runnable

* `Thread` : worker
* `Runnable` : job to be done

=== Thread

* `java.lang.Thread` == Object.
* *thread of execution*
** individual process
** has its own call stack (one *thread* per call stack, vice versa)


* `main()` has a Thread called `main`.
* different JVM implementations may handle threads differently
** write code so that this doesn't matter
* ways to define & instantiate a thread
** extend `Thread`
** implement `Runnable` (preferable)

==== States

image::img/ThreadStates.png[]

[cols="10,40"]
|===
|  `NEW`|
    `Thread` is instantiated. +
    Thread of execution is not yet started. Not alive.
| `RUNNABLE`|
    Thread of execution was started with `start()`. +
    Alive & eligible to be RUNNING.
| `RUNNING` |
    Scheduler chose thread of execution from the runnable pool.
|`BLOCKED`|
    Not eligible to run. +
    Thread is waiting for a different thread to release its lock in order to get the monitor lock.
| `WAITING` |
    Not eligible to run. +
    The thread is waiting by using a wait, join or park method. +
    Usually something in its own `run()` causes the Thread to wait.
| `TIMED_WAITING`|
    Not eligible to run. +
    The thread is waiting by using a sleep, wait, join or park method. +
    (The difference from WAITING is that the maximum waiting time is specified by the method parameter, and WAITING can be relieved by time as well as external changes.)
| `TERMINATED`|
    after `run()` completes.
|===


==== Dead vs. Alive
* Dead : before `start()` is called, after `run()` is completed.
* checked by `isAlive()`.

'''



'''

==== Types
* daemon
** stop working when there are no other non-daemon threads.
** Even if you do not create any threads, the Java application will create several threads by default.
** Most of them are daemon threads, mainly for processing tasks such as garbage collection or JMX.
* non-daemon
** A thread running the 'static void main(String[] args)â€™ method is created as a non-daemon thread,
** and when this thread stops working, all other daemon threads will stop as well.
** (The thread running this main method is called the VM thread in HotSpot VM.)

.Join Example

'''

== Conflicts
* Thread Contention
** thread a holds lock.
** thread b waits for the lock to be lifted.


* deadlock
** special contention
** n threads are waiting for another thread to complete their tasks in order to complete their own tasks.


* thread dump
** gives information on the exact status of each thread





==== Problems
* Race Condition
** 2+ threads (race to) modify shared data
** the outcome is influenced by the scheduler (bad).
* Deadlock
** Thread A owns "foo" waits for "bar"
** Thread B owns "bar" waits for "foo"
** TODO Example
* Livelock
** TODO Example
* Starvation
** Thread A hogs a lock
** Thread A unable to make progress

==== `volatile`
* makes variable atmoic
** write can't be interrupted

'''

==== ThreadSafeClasses
* see `ThreadSafeClass`
* such as `Collections.synchronizedList`
* synchronize only individual methods
** protect only from i.e. `remove()` is not run, twice simultaneously
** does not protect from induced race
* TODO why is this so ... IS maybe `size()` not synchronized??

'''



== Thread Scheduler
* decides which threads should run at any given moment
** threads in the RUNNABLE state are eligible
* takes threads out of the run state.
* can be influenced
* a Thread us guaranteed to complete
* within a thread the order is guarnteed
* with multiple threads
** not guarantedd order in which they start or finish
*** scheduler controls this
* uses *priorities*
** tries to run the thread with highest priority
** usually not necessary to modify directly
** main has default priority
** priority values may differ between JVMs (usually 1,5,10)
*** `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY`
*** `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY`
*** `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY`


// # THREAD

// thread a holds lock.
// thread b waits for the lock to be lifted.
