### OOP Concepts
* Abstraction : a class is an abstraction of the set of members it contains.
* Encapsulation : the practice of keeping fields within a class private,
then providing access to them via public methods
* Inheritance :
* Polymorphism : overloading, overwriting and acessing a subset of features of a class
by acessing it via an interface/parent class.

==== Encapsulation
the process of protecting the state of objects by defining its attributes as private and channeling access to them through accessor and mutator methods

* make field private
* make getter (accessor method) / setter (mutator method) with guards
* naming conventions
* `boolean` : `.isFoo()` : `.setFoo()`
* not `boolean` : `.getFoo()` : `.setFoo()`
