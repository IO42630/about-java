### OOP Concepts
* Abstraction : a class is an abstraction of the set of members it contains.
* Encapsulation : the practice of keeping fields within a class private,
then providing access to them via public methods
* Inheritance :
* Polymorphism : overloading, overwriting and acessing a subset of features of a class
by acessing it via an interface/parent class.

==== AOP
* Aspect Oriented Programming.
* Separate Aspects such as logging, security, caching, ...




==== Encapsulation
* make field private
* make getter (accessor method) / setter (mutator method) with guards
* naming conventions
* `boolean` : `.isFoo()` : `.setFoo()`
* not `boolean` : `.getFoo()` : `.setFoo()`
