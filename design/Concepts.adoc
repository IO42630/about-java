== OOP Concepts

* Abstraction : a class is an abstraction of the set of members it contains.
* Encapsulation : the practice of keeping fields within a class private,
then providing access to them via public methods
* Inheritance :
* Polymorphism : overloading, overwriting and acessing a subset of features of a class
by acessing it via an interface/parent class.

==== AOP
* Aspect Oriented Programming.
* Separate Aspects such as logging, security, caching, ...

==== Encapsulation
the process of protecting the state of objects by defining its attributes as private and channeling access to them through accessor and mutator methods

* make field private
* make getter (accessor method) / setter (mutator method) with guards
** these guards ensure that chosen invariants are maintained.
** invariant : some property that is maintained even after data is modified.
* naming conventions, with someFoo being the var name
** `boolean` : `.isSomeFoo()` : `.getSomeFoo()`  : `.setSomeFoo()`
** not `boolean` : `.getSomeFoo()` : `.setSomeFoo()`
* trivial getters / setters serve a purpose:
** they may be modified, without all of the users of said class having to modify their code.

==== JavaBean
* All properties private (use getters/setters)
* A public no-argument constructor
* Implements Serializable.

==== Composition
* an alternative to (multiple) inheritance.
* have an object contain other objects as fields
** i.e. human has feet, hands & etc.
