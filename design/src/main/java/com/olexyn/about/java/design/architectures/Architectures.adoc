==== Event Driven (EDA)

* Producer
* Router
* Consumer

Similar to our "threads.message" example with:

* Router -> Medium (with some added logic)

=== 3 Tier architecture

* Client -> Logic -> Data
* Open to interpretation where the exact boundaries of each are.

==== Client

* MVC
** some components are duplicated on Client / Server
* Model
** Can be seen as Data Model
*** Dto (TS/Java)
** Can be seen as View Model
*** DOM
* View
** rendered HTML
* Controller
** Sometimes stays within the Client
** Sometimes goes to Server (Endpoint/Controller)

==== Logic

* Services

==== Data

* DAL (Data Abstraction Layer)
** DAO / Repo are both implementations of the DAL.
* DAO (Data Access Object)
** Global Object that implements methods for CRUD on an Entity
* Repo
** Singleton that acts like a Collection of Entity
