Scope statement: is the written form of the boundary

• A narrative of what deliverables or work-products the
project team will and will not provide throughout the
project.
• A first step that provides a high-level abstraction of the
project’s scope that will be defined in greater detail as
the project progresses.
University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

PMBOK® Scope Management Processes

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

24

Work Breakdown Structure
The WBS represents a logical decomposition of the work to be
performed and focuses on how the product, service, or result is
naturally subdivided. It is an outline of what work is to be performed.

Work Package
A Work Package is one element of the logical
decomposition of the WBS. It is a group or related tasks to
be performed in order to meet a given objective. It is often
associated to deliverables and milestones

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

25

Deliverables and milestones
Deliverables are tangible, verifiable work products
- Reports, presentations
- Mockups, prototypes
- Information system, code archive
- …

Milestones are significant events or achievements
- Acceptance of deliverables or phase completion
- Proof of concepts
- Quality control
- …

• Deliverables and milestones keep team focused
• Often associated to WPs
University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

27

WP template

29

Developing the WBS
• Often, the WBS is crafted from the phases and deliverables of the project
• Phases and deliverables can be defined in a Deliverable Structure Chart

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

To which level of granularity should we go
in the detail of a WP?
• Comment on the following example.
Activity
6.2.2.1 send out invitations
6.2.2.2 phase 1 test (1day)
6.2.2.2.1 book room
6.2.2.2.2 organize the staff
6.2.2.2.3 do the test
6.2.2.2.4 prepare reimbursment
print / accouting etccc.
6.2.2.3 phase 2 test

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

31

Developing the WBS
• The WBS should be deliverable-oriented
• The WBS should support the project's MOV
- Ensure WBS allows for the delivery of all the project’s
deliverables as defined in project scope

• The level of detail should support planning and control
• Developing the WBS should involve the people who
will be doing the work
• Learning cycles and lessons learned can support the
development of a WBS

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

32

Time Estimating Techniques
• Guesstimating
- Based on feeling and not facts
- Not a good method for estimating but often used by experienced
project managers

• Delphi Technique
- Involves multiple, anonymous experts
- Each expert makes an estimate
- Estimates are compared
-

If close, can be averaged

-

If diverging, discussion and another iteration until consensus is reached
start to consider risks

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

35

Project estimation
• Time Boxing
- Not really an estimation method but a way to limit the time on a
given task or set of tasks
- A “box” of time is allocated for a specific activity, task, or
deliverable
- The principle is that the box cannot be extended!
- Can focus a team if used effectively
- Can demoralize a team if used too often or ineffectively because
of the increased stress or pressure on the project team to get
things done

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

37

Project estimation
• Top-Down Estimating
- Top and middle managers determine overall project schedule
and/or cost.
- Lower level managers are expected to breakdown schedule/
budget estimates into specific activities (WBS).
- Often couched in terms of what a project should cost and how
long it should take as decreed by a member of top
management who thinks those parameters are appropriate.
- May be a response to the business environment.
- May lead to a death march project

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

38

Project estimation
• Bottom-Up Estimating
- Most common form of project estimation
- Schedules & budgets are constructed from the WBS
- Starts with people who will be doing the work
- Schedules & budgets are the aggregate of detailed activities &
costs

• Analogous estimating
- Based on similarity between current projects and others
- Use information from previous, similar projects as a basis for
estimation

COCOMO – COnstructive COst MOdel
• Parametric Model developed by Barry Boehm in 1981
• 1st step is to determine the project types
- Organic
-

Routine projects where the work is expected to go smoothly with few
problems

- Embedded
-

Challenging projects that may be new ground for the organization or
project team

- Semi-detached
-

In between organic and embedded. Projects that may not be simple and
straightforward, but there is a high degree of confidence that the project
team can meet the challenge

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

52

COCOMO Models (Effort)
• Organic – Routine
- Person Months = 2.4 * KDSI1.05

• Embedded – Challenging
- Person Months = 3.6 * KDSI1.20

• Semi-Detached – Middle
- Person Months = 3.0 * KDSI1.12

• KDSI = thousands of delivered source instructions

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

53

COCOMO – Effort Example
• Semi-Detached
- We estimate that the software includes 210 Function Points

210 FP * 53 = 11,130 Java LOC
Person Months = 3.0 * KDSI1.12
= 3.0 * (11.13) 1.12
= 44.6

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

54

COCOMO Models (Duration)
• People and months are not always interchangeable.
Estimating the real duration involves a factor.
Organic
Duration = 2.5 * Effort0.38
Semi-Detached
Duration = 2.5 * Effort0.35
Embedded
Duration = 2.5 * Effort0.32

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

55

COCOMO duration example
Duration = 2.5 * Effort0.35
= 2.5 * 44.6 0.35
= 9.44 months
People Required = Effort / Duration
= 44.6 / 9.44
= 4.72
≃ 5 persons

The project schedule builds upon the WBS by
identifying the sequence of activities as well as the
interdependencies.
• In other words: put it all together to determine the start and end
dates for the project
• Various project management tools can be used to build the
network of activities
• Iterations may be necessary
- To refine the schedule

• A realistic project schedule is the goal!

Critical path
The Critical Path determines the shortest time the
project can be completed
• Build the possible activity paths and determine the longest path (see next
table)
• Must be monitored and managed!
- The Critical Path can change
- We can have multiple CPs
- Fast tracking – running activities in parallel which were originally planned as sequential
- Monitor the zero slack - the amount of time we can delay an activity before it delays
the project

Disclaimer about the 3 previous slides
• There are actual statistical distributions behind task duration estimates
- Distribution functions can be different for each and every task, depending to the
nature of the task
- For example: beta, normal, tent
- The beta distribution corresponds to natural task completion (more effort to the end)

• Some tools will deduce the “most likely” estimate column from the
optimistic and pessimistic estimates making an assumption on the
statistical distribution (for example beta)
• Summing the expected durations is a simplistic approach and can lead
to optimistic estimates
- It all depends to the distribution of the different tasks durations
- Recent tools such as @RISK uses Monte-Carlo simulation especially useful when
the distributions are different from tasks to tasks.

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

76

Precedence Diagramming Method
• Additional tool for understanding the relationships among project activities
• Based on 4 fundamental relationships

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

77

Lead and lag times
• Lead is starting the next task before the first task is
complete
- Example: Begin installing the operating systems when half of
the PCs are set up

• Lag (or negative lead) is the adding of a buffer of time
before the next task begins
- Example: Once the walls have been painted, wait one day
before laying the carpet so that the walls have had a chance to
dry

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

78

Project Management Software Tools
• A number of project management software tools are
available to plan and track the progress of your project
• However, having a fundamental understanding of
these project management techniques is important to
make the most out of these software tools

Developing the
budget
5 steps
Type of costs

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

86

Developing the project budget
1. Define what resources will be needed to perform the
work
2. Determine the quantity of resources that are needed
3. Define the resource cost for each resource
4. Calculate the activity cost
5. Ensure that the resources are leveled
- No over-allocations: resources have not been over assigned to
more than one task scheduled at the same time
- Few under-allocations: don’t leave resources doing nothing

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

87

Other costs
• Mostly used:
- Direct Costs
-

The direct cost of labor or other resources

- Indirect Costs
-

The cost for covering such things as rent, utilities, insurance, etc.

• Sometimes used:
- Sunk Costs
-

Costs incurred prior to the project such as a project that has been restarted after a failed
attempt

- Learning Curve
-

Often have to “build one and throw it away” to understand a problem or a new technology

- Reserves
-

Contingency funds to be used at the discretion of the project manager

PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT

(LINK WITH PMBOK)

PMBOK® Project Cost Management
• Resource planning
• Cost estimating
Based upon the activities, their time estimates, and the resource
requirements, a cost estimate for each activity can be developed.

• Cost budgeting
Once estimation is obtained, an overall cost estimated for the project can
be made. Once approved, this estimate becomes the project budget

• Cost control
Proper processes and procedures are put into place to control
changes to the project bugdet

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

Choosing a SDLC methodology

• What methodology are we going to chose to execute
the plan and develop the system?
• We can chose from strict waterfall to pure agile with a
set of intermediary methodologies - see slides of PHASE III for more details
• The choice will depend to the context of the project
• The chosen methodology will have impacts on the
way we do plan the project in this PHASE II
- on the WBS
- on the level of a priori details of planning
- on the used estimation techniques
University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

93

Impact of the methodology on the WBS
• A waterfall approach will typically show a WBS synchronized
with the phases of the SDLC
- WP1: Analysis
- WP2: Design
- WP3: Implementation
- WP4: Tests

• An agile approach will typically show a WBS synchronized with
the releases including a rough description of product features
for each release
- WP1: Release 1.0
- WP2: Release 2.0
- ...
University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

94

Impact of the methodology on the level of
details in planning
• Waterfall will attempt to plan everything precisely
- Change will be very embarrassing
- Uncertainty on tasks duration is covered by inflating estimates

• Agility will plan a un-detailed set of product
functionalities that will be prioritized
- Change is embraced
- Uncertainty on tasks duration is part of the game

University of Fribourg - Jean Hennebert

95

Impact of the methodology on the
estimation techniques
• A waterfall approach will typically use traditional
estimation techniques
- Delphi, FPA, Cocomo2

• An agile approach will typically use bottom-up
approaches
- Often relying on a reduction of the uncertainty along the project,
allowing for fast ongoing estimations
- Often based on poker planning to estimate collaboratively

Conclusions
• Finalizing the Project Schedule and Budget
- The project schedule and budget may require several iterations
before it is acceptable to the sponsor, the project manager, and
the project team
- Once the project schedule and project plan are accepted, the
project plan becomes the baseline plan.
- Once accepted, the project manager and project team have the
authority to execute or carry out the plan ; we enter in PHASE III

From strategy to tactic
Activity

• Can we now answer the tactic related questions?
1. Who is the project manager, project sponsor?
2. Who is on the project team? What role does everyone play?
3. What is the scope of the project?
4. How much will the project cost?
5. How long will it take to complete the project?
6. What resources and technology will be required?
7. What approach, tools and techniques will be used to develop the information
system?
8. What tasks or activities will be required to perform the project work?
9. How long will these tasks or activities take?
10.Who will be responsible for performing these tasks or activities?
11.What will the organization receive for the time, money and resources invested
