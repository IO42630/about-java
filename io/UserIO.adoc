== User IO

{empty} +

==== Overview
* `System.out` and `System.err` are `PrintStream` (old)
* `System.in: InputStream` (old)
* `System.console(): Console` is a singleton (new)
** `Console.reader(): Reader`
** `Console.writer(): PrintWriter`

{empty} +

==== PrintStream/Writer
* both `PrintStream` and `PrintWriter` independently implement the following methods:
** `.print()`
*** overloaded  with all primitives / String / Object
*** generally performs String.valueOf()
** `println()` : useful as linebreak may depend on JVM
*** `System.getProperty("line.separator");`
** `.format()` (see examples)
** `.checkError()` to detect presence of problem after attempted write

==== PrintWriter
* PrintWriter(OutputStream)
** `.write()`  (inherited from Writer, throws IOException )

==== Console

* `System.console()` can result in null, in sys where no console is supported
* inherits flush()
** recommended to call before readLine / readPassword
* `.readLine()`
** similar to `BufferedReader.readLine()`
** also contains `.readLine(String)` for user prompt
* `.readPassword()`
** disables display of the text the user entered
** also has `.readPassword(String)`
** returns char[], so that pwd does not enter stringpool,
and can be cleared after verifying validity
