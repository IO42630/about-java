== IO

=== NIO.2
Differences to java.io streams.

* buffers / channels instead of streams
* load date from file channel into temp buffer, that
** unlike streams, can be read forward and backward without blocking the underlying resource
* NIO.1 was not popular



==== Path
vs File

* File is a class
* Path is an interface
** implemented by classes depending on which System the action is performed.


* replacement for legacy class `java.io.File`
* Path unlike File supports symbolic links
** pointer to another file/directory.
