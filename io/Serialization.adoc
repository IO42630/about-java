=== Serialization

* good practice
* have static long serialVersionUID and
** Java does his auto
** however recommended to do manually, because possible mismatch between jdks
* not all classes can be `Serializable` such as Thread are too complex to be easily serialized


* `ObjectOutputStream.writeObject(Object)`
* `ObjectInputStream.readObject(): Object`
* both support `null` , thus check must be performed
** in example done by instanceof

When deserializing

* Java calls no-arg constructor of first non-serializable parent class,
* skipping the constructors of any serialized class in between
* static vars and default initialziations are ignored
