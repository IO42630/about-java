=== Enums
* An `enum` is a fixed set of calls to a constructor of a particular "enum-type".
** the set can't be extended.
* full enum Example see `Enum`
** includes usually hidden segments
** comments in table below.

|===
| the enum construct | `public enum SomeEnum { A, B, C, D}`
| enum-type |  `SomeEnum`
| calls to constructor of enum-type | `A, B, C, D`
| reference to instance created by constructor calls +
> when first reference is made, +
. then all the constructor calls are executed. +
> also called enum-value
|  `SomeEnum foo == SomeEnum.A;`
|===
[source,java]
foo == SomeEnum.A; // true
(SomeEnum.A.toString()).equals(SomeEnum.A.name());     // true, string value is "A"
SomeEnum.A.ordinal() // returns linear position of enum constant instance



* Enum usage in `switch` see `control.Control.adoc#Switch`
* Enums are top-level constructs
* Enum types (i.e. `SomeEnum`) can't be instantiated directly (i.e. `new SomeEnum() -> cErr`)

===== static methods
|===
|`static enum[] values()` | returns array
|`Season.valueOf("SUMMER")` | returns instance that matches param, as if reverse of `Enum.SUMMER.name()`.

===== Constructor
* must be `private`
*** `private` keyword may be omitted
* Enum-instances can't access private members (e.g. `baz`) of enum via `this.baz`.
** still possible via `SomeEnum.A.baz`
** can also access private members of other enum-instances
