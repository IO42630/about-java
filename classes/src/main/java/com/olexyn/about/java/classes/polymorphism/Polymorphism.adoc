=== Polymorphism
|===
|`class.polymorphism.Polymorphism.java`
|===
Poly = Ability to reference a class by super or interface. +
In reverse this means : setting param type to super and supplying any of the sub-classes.




==== 2 Types of Polymorphism
* Overloading (C-Time Poly) : resolved at C-Time
* Overriding (R-Time Poly) : resolved at R-Time
** Example below: +
Compiler will check if all calls to `foo` are with param of type `Parent`. +
Compiler will *not* check if all call to `foo` are with param of type `Child`. +
If it so happens that `p` is not of type `Child` -> `rErr`.
*** Similarly if p was a local variable +
Basically when we write Parent p = new Child(); +

[source,java]
void foo(Parent p){
    Child c = (Child) p;
}
//
Parent p = new Child1(); // the compiler only checks if the object can match the reference,
// and forgets the rest.
Interface i = (Interface) p; // child may implement interface or not - the compiler doesn't remember
// -> `rErr` (if Child1 doesn't happen to be implementing Interface)

[source,java]
Chi1d1 c = new Child2(); // cErr

* To the compiler it is very clear, that Child2 can
** neither implement Child1 (as Child1 is a class),
** nor extend Child1 (since Child2 already extends Parent).
*** -> cErr

{empty} +

* type of _object_ (in memory)
** immutable
* type of reference (data type)
** determines API (what methods / vars can be accessed)
* Casting to child == reclaiming the full API of the child class.

==== instanceof

[cols="8,1,8"]
|===
| `X` covariant to `Y` | => |  `X instanceof Y` is `true`
2+|  always  |`X instanceof Object` is `true`
2+| always | `X instanceof null` is `false`
| `X` can be implicit cast to `Y` |=> |  `X instanceof Y` is true
| X need to be explicit cast to Y +
> even if `ClassCastException` would occur
| => | X instanceof Y == false
|casting X to Y -> `cErr` | => | `X instance Y` -> `cErr`

[source,java]
class Parent {
    void foo(){ bar();}
    void bar(){}
}
class Child {
    void bar(){}
}
// calling
Parent parent = new Child();
parent.foo(); // will still call bar() in Child

=== Errors
* casting an Parent instance to a Child instance results in ClassCastException.
