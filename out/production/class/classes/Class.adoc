==== General

* `.java` file can have 0..1 public top-level classes.
    ** `C-Error` if filename does not match name of public class.
* `this.var` references current and inherited members
    ** used do set apart instance/class variables from parameters/local variables
* `super.var` reference to inherited members
    ** used to call members of the Parent class from the Child class.
* `this(int i)` is used to call overloaded Constructor.
* Java supports only single inheritance

==== Ordering of Elements

[options=header]
|===
|Element|Example|Required|Placement
|Package declaration | `package foo;`|NO | First line in the file
|Import statements | `import bar.*;`|NO | After the package
|Class declaration | `public class C`| YES | After import
|Field declarations | `int i;`| NO | Any top-level element in class
|Method declarations | `void method()` | NO |  Any top-level element in class
|===

'''
==== Constructors
* The purpose of a _constructor_ is to initialize fields.
* Matches the name of the class.
* May have different access modifiers.
    ** Overloading rules do apply.
* If a user-declared constructor is present,
    ** then the default constructor is not declared in the background.
    *** Thus calling the default constructor `-> C-Error`.
    *** having a private constructor effectively disables the instantiation of the class from outside.
**** it can only be extended by inner classes.
* `this()` and `super()` must be the first statement in the constructor
    ** `Foo(){this();}` does not Compile, likewise other circular references caused by constructors.
* If no `this()` or `super()` are present, then the compiler inserts a `super()` in the background
    ** since compiler inserts super() the parent constructor is called in every child
* Relevant:
    ** Parent has no-default constructor
    ** Child has no (or no matching) constructor.
    ** C-Error, since compiler will insert call to default constructor of parent.
* super() refers to most direct parent
* see `about.basics.classes.Constructors`

'''

==== Order of Initialization
* aka _class loading_
* a `class` is initialized either when
    *** program starts
    *** static member of the class is referenced
    *** shortly before instance of class is created

===== Order
. `static`
    .. init `super` first (start with highest)
    .. `static` var declarations (in order of appearance)
    .. `static` initializers (in order of appearance)
. `instance`
    .. init `super` first
    .. instance var declaration (in order of appearance)
    .. instance initializers (in order of appearance)
    .. Initialize the constructor including any overloaded constructors referenced with `this()`.
        ... `this()` or `super()` if present
        ... default `super()`
. what ever instance method is called

=== Inheritance
* Only members are inherited.



==== Subtype and Supertype
* if X subtype of Y , then
    ** X, Y class -> X subclass of Y
    ** X, Y interface -> X subinterface of Y
    ** X class, Y interface -> X implements Y (directly or through superclass)

==== Overload vs Override vs Hide vs Redeclare
[options=header, cols="1,2,1,1,1,1,2"]
|===
|    | member | modifier |name |param | return type| effect
|Overload | instance method | | same | __different__ | __any__ |
|Override | instance method | |  same | __same__ | __covariant__ | replaces the parent method. +
(even if the parent-type is used as reference)
|Hide | instance field, +
static field, +
static method | | same | same | covariant | replaces the member only +
if a Child reference type is used.
|Redeclare | | (both) private  | same | same | _any_ | is always ok, +
(accessing the member +
from outside the class +
is prohibited).
|Illegal | | !private | same | same | !covariant|

=== Abstract Classes
|===
| `classes.AbastractDemo.java`
| `interfaces.Interfaces.adoc`
|===

* abstract class may contain concrete members
** concrete class may NOT contain abstract members
* abstract methods
** without body: `abstract void foo();`
** does not define an implementation upon declaration
** must be overridden in first _concrete class_
*** overriding rules _DO_ apply
* `abstract_class` classes may contain anything an concrete class contains
** not true vice-versa


==== Constructors in Abstract
* main difference:
    * can only be called by instantiating subclass
* see `about.basics.classes.AbstractDemo`

=== Poly and Ifaces
* when using abstract reference (e.g. inface) for concrete class
    ** wish to access memeber which exist in concrete class only
    ** explicit cast from e.g. infterface to class
        *** mus be compatible
* `instance_of`
    ** if reference type is final compiler will detect
    ** if reference type is abstract it might be extended to become an instance of
        *** thus compiler can't check

==== Inner Classes / Interfaces
* member of a class
* can have all 4 access modifiers ( top-level classes/interfaces can only be public/default)
* can't contain static methods

=== Nesting
All 4 Types are considered nested. Non-static nested classes are called inner classes.

[options=header]
|===
| 4 Types| static nested | member inner | local inner | anon inner
| 2+| same level as fields 2+|within method
| | static | instance | | without name
| access modif 2+| ALL 2+| none, already local to method
| Can extend, implement. +
Can be `abstract`, `final`. 3+| YES | NO, zero. +
Instead it is assigned to one `super` or `iface` at declaration
|access to instance members of enclosing class +
(incl. private vars) | NO 3+|YES
|access local var of enclosing method | NO +
Not applicable, since member-inner can't contain static members. |YES +
If member inner of local inner. (and if final or eff-final)
2+|YES, if final or effectively-final.
|Declare `static` methods. | YES 3+|NO
|===

==== General
* nested / inner are treated as separate namespaces.

{empty} +

==== Static Nested
* may be static-imported:
[source,java]
package somepkg;
public class Enclosing{ static class Nested{} }
//
import static somepkg.Enclosing.Nested;


{empty} +

==== Local Inner
* Local inner class instance can't be returned by enclosing method.

{empty} +

==== Anon Inner
* Required to  extend an existing class or implement an existing interface.
* Can be a param:
[source,java]
void bar(SomeAnon some){}
void foo(){
    return bar(new SomeAnon{ void baz(){} });
}
