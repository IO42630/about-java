== Primitives
Java works with _objects_ that contain collections of primitive data types.

| _variable_ | > is of a certain reference type +
> holds a _reference_
| _reference_ | > holds the address of an _instance_ +
. > always of same size (=length) +
> `new Object()` returns a new reference +
> a reference can be held by multiple variables
| _instance_ | > holds the physical address of an _object_ +
> the physical address is invisible in Java.
| _object_ | > physical object in memory +
> `new Object()` causes an _object_ to be created in memory

[source,java]
Object obj = null;       // obj is a variable. here it holds a referenct to null
new Object();            // new Object() is an reference to an instance of the Object class
obj = new Object();      // obj now holds a reference to an instance of the Object class
//
System.out.print(obj);   // java.lang.Object@6acbcfc0

==== 8 Primitive Types
* Contain a pointer to a value in memory.
    ** Thus have fixed size.
    ** Thus upon declaring a Primitive Type, Java will directly allocate memory according to the size of the Primitive Type.
* Can't contain `null` (as they donÂ´t contain an pointer to an _object_ in the first place).


==== Reference Type
* holds pointer to memory address of object
    ** unlike other Languages, Java does not allow to know what the physical memory adress is
* a reference can be assigend to another object of the a compatible type

==== mutable vs immutable
* primitives are immutable
* String , Integer , Char etc. are immutable
* StringBuilder, List are mutable

'''

==== Wrapper Classes
* Wrapper classes make use of some caching, somilar to the pool for String
* The ability of Wrappers to contain `null` is useful for data services.

|P-Type  | W-Class | .valueOf(<>) | Wrapper.parse<>()
|boolean | Boolean | true |
|byte    |         | |
|short   | Short   |  |
|int     | Integer | | parseInt
|long    | Long    | | parseLong
|float   | Float   | (float) 1.0)|
|double  | Double | 1.0|
|char    | Character | 'c'

[source,java]
int primitive = Integer.parseInt("123");
Integer wrapper = Integer.valueOf("123"); // may throw NumberformatException



===== Autoboxing & Unboxing
* Autoboxing
** Primitive -> Wrapper
** `Integer integer = 50;`
* Unboxing
** Wrapper -> Primitive
** `int i = integer;`
** NullPointerException: `int i = new Integer(null)`
