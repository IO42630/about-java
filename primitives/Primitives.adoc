== Primitives
* Java works with _objects_ that contain collections of primitive data types.
* literal : value of a primitive, e.g. 1
** source code representation of a fixed value;
** represented directly in your code without requiring computation.
** `null` : literal that can be used as a value for any reference type,
*** except variables of primitive types.

[source,java]
Object obj = null;       // obj is a variable. here it holds a referenct to null
new Object();            // new Object() is an reference to an instance of the Object class
obj = new Object();      // obj now holds a reference to an instance of the Object class
//
System.out.print(obj);   // java.lang.Object@6acbcfc0

==== 8 Primitive Types
* Contain a pointer to a value in memory.
    ** Thus have fixed size.
    ** Thus upon declaring a Primitive Type, Java will directly allocate memory according to the size of the Primitive Type.
* Can't contain `null` (as they donÂ´t contain an pointer to an _object_ in the first place).

| type  |  bit |  range | Example
| boolean | 1 | true / false | true
| byte |  8 | -128 to 127  | 123
| short | 16 | -2^15 to 2^15-1 | 123
| int | 32 | -2^31 to 2^31-1 | 123
| long | 64   |   | 123L
| float| 32  |IEEE 754  | 123.45f
| double| 64  |   |  123.456
| char | 16  |Unicode, \u0000 (0) to \uffff (2^16-1)  | 'a'
|===

* char is \u0000 in hex thus 16^4 = (2^4)^4 = 2^16 ... this again is like short.

==== Reference Type
* holds pointer to memory address of object
    ** unlike other Languages, Java does not allow to know what the physical memory adress is
* a reference can be assigend to another object of the a compatible type

==== mutable vs immutable
* primitives are immutable
* String , Integer , Char etc. are immutable
* StringBuilder, List are mutable

==== Wrapper Classes
* Wrapper classes make use of some caching, somilar to the pool for String
* The ability of Wrappers to contain `null` is useful for data services.

[source,java]
int primitive = Integer.parseInt("123");
Integer wrapper = Integer.valueOf("123"); // may throw NumberformatException

===== Autoboxing & Unboxing
* Autoboxing
** Primitive -> Wrapper
** `Integer integer = 50;`
* Unboxing
** Wrapper -> Primitive
** `int i = integer;`
** NullPointerException: `int i = new Integer(null)`
