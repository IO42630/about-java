### OOP Concepts
* Abstraction : a class is an abstraction of the set of members it contains.
* Encapsulation : the practice of keeping fields within a class private, 
then providing access to them via public methods
* Inheritance : 
* Polymorphism : overloading, overwriting and acessing a subset of features of a class 
by acessing it via an interface/parent class.
