==== Dependency Injection (DI)

* See `design/decoupling/levels/Levels.adoc` for an overview.
* DI is the opposite of _dependency lookup_
** resource is retrieved after demand
** `A obj = new AImpl();`
** `A obj = A.getA(); // using factory`
** tight coupling
** complicates testing
* Spring supports
** Constructor injection
** Method injection (by setter)
