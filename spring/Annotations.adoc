== A

==== @Autowired

Automatic injection of beans, instead of using XML-config. +
Used with @Qualifier to avoid confusion when we have two of more beans for same type.

{empty} +

== B
==== @Bean

Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container. +
This is one of the most used and important spring annotation. +
@Bean annotation also can be used with parameters like name, initMethod and destroyMethod.

* name – allows you give name for bean
* initMethod – allows you to choose method which will be invoked on context register
* destroyMethod – allows you to choose method which will be invoked on context shutdown

== C
==== @Configuration
Used to indicate that a class declares one or more @Bean methods. +
These classes are processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime.




==== @ComponentScan
Configures component scanning directives for use with @Configuration classes. +
Here we can specify the base packages to scan for spring components.


==== @Conditional

==== @ControllerAdvice

{empty} +

== E
==== @EnableAutoConfiguration
Spring Boot

==== @Entity
JPA annotation to make this object ready for storage in a JPA-based data store.

{empty} +

== I
==== @Inject
==== @InitBinder

{empty} +

== M
==== @ModelAttribute

{empty} +

== N
==== @Named

{empty} +

== O

{empty} +

== P
==== @PathVariable
Used to indicate type of parameter in method REST-endpoint.
See `@RequestParameter`.

==== @PostConstruct
alternative way for bean initMethod +
It can be used when the bean class is defined by us

==== @PreDestroy
alternative way for bean destroyMethod +
It can be used when the bean class is defined by us

==== @PropertySource
provides a simple declarative mechanism for adding a property source to Spring’s Environment. +
There is a similar annotation for adding an array of property source files i.e `@PropertySources`.

==== @Profile
An app can be run with different profiles. Profiles are sets of parameters.

== Q
==== @Query
