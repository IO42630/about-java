=== 3 Ways

* This Demo shows 3 ways to configure DI
** A : XML
** B : java (`@Configuration`/`@Bean`)
** C : auto
*** `@Configuration` : this is config
*** `@ComponentScan(path)` : where to scan for components
*** `@Component` : this is component
*** `@Autowired` : inject this
* The Demo consists of creating a `ParentBean.NestedBean.String`

=== 3 Types

* SDI (Setter)
* CDI (Constructor)
* FDI (Field, since 2.5 ~ @Autowired)

=== @Import

* Import other `@Configuration`

=== @Qualifier

* used with @Autowire to distinguish bean instances of same type.
* differes based on 'way'
** B : 'qualifier' matches `@Bean qualifier()`
** C : 'qualifier' matches `@Component("qualifier")`
* can write own custome 'qualifiers' (skip due to scope, see https://www.baeldung.com/spring-autowire)

=== Trivia

* Annotation DI was added in Spring 2.5
* Annotation DI happens before XML, thus overriden if overlapping.
