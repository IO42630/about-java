= Bean Config

* This demo shows 2 ways to load properties:
** `Evironment` (see `AppConfig`)
** `@Value` (see `beans.ValueConfiguredBean`)
* Spring has an predefined `@Autowire Evironment.getProperty("foo")`
** by default it contains only:
*** `systemProperties`
*** `systemEnvironment`
** more can be added through `.properties` files
*** these are added manually with `@PropertySource`
*** it does not matter where the `@PropertySource` is used,
**** as long as it is in `@ComponentScan` path, it will be loaded.
**** must be used with `@Configuration` or child thereof.
*** `@PropertySource` uses `classpath` (as defined in `pom/build/resources`)
* Any property that is in `Evironment` can be accessed via `@Value("${foo}")`

* Also `BeanConsumerService` shows how `@Qualifier` can be used to select bean.



== Trivia

* sometimes (?TODO) a `@Bean PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` is required to resolve the `@PropertySource`.
