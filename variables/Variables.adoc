==== Variables
* Variables can't be declared outside of a class or interface.
* _field_ : variable declared outside of method, but inside class.
** Instance Variable: (non-static) , declared within a Class.
** Class Variable : `static` , declared within a Class.
* Local Variable : declared within a Constructor, Method or Initializer Block.

[source,java]
int i; // declaration
i = 1; // write access "set"
i = i + 1; // read & write access "get & set"

{empty} +

==== final vs constant
* *final variable* a var that is marked final
* *constant* (also called compile-time-constant) : +
final primitive or String that is initialized with an literal (not a method)
on the line it is declared
*** _constant_ ~ initialized when declared
*** _constant_ ~ not initialized by method (happens at runtime)

{empty} +

===== Identifier Name
* must begin with letter , $ or _
* can include numbers
* a single _ is not allowed as identifier (since Java 9)
* cannot be reserved
* can't contain non char operators e.g. `+` , `%` , `~`
* unicode letters, e.g. arabic are allowed.

{empty} +

===== Compound Declaration

* may or may not be initialized.
* only one type declaration allowed.

[source,java]
int i1, i2, i3=0; // OK
int a, int b; // NO , multiple declarations not allowed.
int i1, String s1; // NO , multiple declarations & not of the same type.
int a; int b; // OK , two statements.
int a; b; // NO , b is not a statement.

{empty} +

===== Initializing Variables
* Instance Variables have default values:

[source,java]
boolean                  false
byte, short, int, long   0
float, double            0.0
char                     '\u0000' (NUL)
Objects                 null



* Local Variables do not hat a default value
** compiler will throw error, if the code reads an un-init var

[source,java]
int i, x;
if (check){
    i=0; x=0;
} else {
    i=1;
}
int a = i; // OK // i is initialized either way
int b = x; // NO // reading uninitialized variable

{empty} +

==== Parameters (constructor or method)
* are local variables, that have been pre-initialized
* cErr: `int i; find(i);`

{empty} +

====  Local Variable Type Inference `var`

|===
|can only be used with local variables | can't be used with fields
|must be initialized when declared | can't be used with parameters
|can be used for reference types | can't be assigend `null` , +
since impossible to guess type.
|is a _reserved type name_.  ''' can't be used for _class_, _interface_, or _enum_ declarations | is not a _reserved word_.
|- |can't be used in multiple-var declaration
|===

==== Scope
* the scope of the variable is the code block it is declared in
* for parameters the scope is the method/class
** start: when declared
** end: when brace is closed
* instance var
** start: when declared
** end: lifetime of object ends (object eligible for GC)
* class var
** start: when declared
** end: life of the program ends

{empty} +
{empty} +

==== GC
* all Objects are stored in _heap_ (_free store_).
** pool of unused memory allocated to the Java application.
* Object is _eligible for GC_ = no longer accessible in program
** Object no longer has any references pointing to it.
** all references to the Object have gone out of scope.

[source,Java]
System.gc();

* suggests JVM to do GC, JVM may comply.
* Example

[source,Java]
String a = new String("a");
String b = new String("b");
a=b; // String "a" just went out of scope
b=null; // String "b" is still in scope

* Side Node:
** finalize() was intended to run when the object was GCd.
** it can run only once
** not part of exam, since deprecated
