* Java EE
** Java Enterprise Edition (Currently rebranded as Jakarta EE).
** Specification that is related to JAVA SE.
** It includes all the classes in Java SE, plus a number that are more useful to programs that run on servers as opposed to workstations.
* Java SE Java Platform, Standard Edition
** Specification of a computing platform for development and deployment.
* Oracle JDK Java Development Kit
** Oracle's implementation of Java SE
* String JRE = "Java Runtime Environment" +
** contains a stand-alone JVM (HotSpot)" +
** the Java standard library (Java Class Library) and a configuration tool";
* String Android_VM = "Google's implementation" +
** Incompatible with the JVM spec." +
** Instad Gooles Dev Kit takes Java programs as input and outputs Dalvik bytecode." +
** This Dalvik bytecode is then the native input for the Android VM.";

==== Interpreter vs. Compiler


|===
|Interpreter | Compiler
|Translates program one statement at a time.| Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.
|It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is slower.| It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster.
|No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory efficient.|Generates intermediate object code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory.
|Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops.Hence debugging is easy.| It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program.Hence debugging is comparatively hard.
|Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreters.| Programming language like C, C++ use compilers.
|===

===== Java
* Compiler translates Source Code to Bytecode
* Interpreter (=JVM) translates the Bytecode into Machine Code for the particular OS.

==== 8 Benefits
[cols="10,20"]
|===
|Object Oriented | All code is defined in classes.
|Encapsualtion | - Access modifiers ''' - Local scope of variables
|Platform Independent | bytecode runs in any JVM
|Robust| no memory leaks
| Simple | no pointers, no operator overloading
| Secure | JVM creates a sandbox
| Multithreaded |
| Backward Compatibility | APIs about to be obsolete are flagged as _depreciated_ .

==== Building Blocks
* _keyword_ word with special meaning.
* _variables_ hold state
** have _type_
* _methods_ operate on state
* _member_ all that is inherited
** _fields_ : variable declared outside of method, but inside class.
** _methods_ (=functions) (operate on state)
*** methods have parameters
*** _method signature_ = name + parameter types
*** _method declaration_ = full line (?)
** _nested classes_
** _interfaces_
** _enumerated types_
** NOT _Constructors_ , since those are not inherited.
* Comment
* `/* */ */` does not compile, as there is one `*/` too much.

|`Integer integer = new Integer(0);` | `<type> <name>   = new     <constructor> ;`
|`{}` | block
|`a=1+1;` , `a++;` | statement
|`1+1` , `a++` | expression

[source,java]
 // a brace is missing == "balanced parantheses problem"
public class Foo {    // class definition
    {int bar = 1;}    // instance initializer
    void bob(int i){  // method definition
        {i++;}        // inner block
